# workout-app
A workout APP made with PHP, JS, CSS and HTML, this is the final port to Android version, It has some buggs but the calories counter is working! 
I'll upload a new branch with the Desktop Version very soon ! ðŸ¥³

# Use: âœ¨

You can check the Desktop Version (recommended to use on ðŸ“± dispositives):
