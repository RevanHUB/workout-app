# workout-app

A workout APP made with PHP, JS, CSS and HTML, this is the final port to Android version, It has some bugs but the calories counter is working! 
I'll upload a new branch with the Desktop Version very soon ! ðŸ¥³

# Use: âœ¨
``` git clone https://github.com/RevanHUB/workout-app/ ```

You can check the Desktop Version (recommended to use on ðŸ“± dispositives): 

```https://david-martin-webdev.com/workout ```

Or you can just go to releases and download it:

# Credentials for testing: âœ¨
``` ðŸ“²  Username: test_user ```
``` ðŸ”” Password: test_user ```


In the next days, I will provide the code as open source with db structure! Hope you like it! ðŸ¥°
